# /*!
#     @abstract
#         Reorders a list of C headers in dependency order.
#     @discussion
#         The dependency calculation is fairly straightforward.  For 
#         each header, HeaderDoc reads the list of <code>#include</code>
#         and <code>#import</code> directives.  Then, for each input file:
#
#         <ul>
#             <li>HeaderDoc looks to see if a dependency object with that filename exists.  A
#                 preexisting dependency object can occur for two reasons: because another
#                 header has declared a dependency on it previously or because another header
#                 with the same name has already been scanned.</li>
#             <li>If the dependency exists and the <code>EXISTS</code> flag is set on that
#                 object, HeaderDoc knows that it has already processed a header with the
#                 same name, and HeaderDoc emits a warning, then creates a new dependency
#                 object.</li>
#             <li>If the dependency object exists and the <code>EXISTS</code> flag is not set.
#                 HeaderDoc sets the <code>EXISTS</code> flag on the existing dependency object.</li>
#             <li>If the dependency object does not exist, it creates a new node and sets the
#                 <code>EXISTS</code> flag.</li>
#             <li>HeaderDoc creates dependencies for each header that it includes, nested within
#                 the dependency object for this input file.</li>
#         </ul>
#
#         After creating these child dependencies for every header, the result is a graph of
#         dependencies, with cycles.
#
#         Finally, the code performs a depth-first walk of the graph (with cycle detection).
#         Because each object is guaranteed to be lower in the graph for at least one path
#         through the graph than any file on which it depends (ignoring circular dependencies),
#         this is sufficient to ensure that any file is processed prior to any file that it
#         includes.
#
#     @result
#         Returns the result of a depth-first walk of the dependency graph in the form of a
#         dependency-ordered array.
#
#     @var force
#         Set if the dependency object was found, but refers to a different header
#         (<code>EXISTS</code> is set).  This forces a new object to be created in
#         spite of the existence of another object with the same name.
