.SH "NAME"
git-log \- Show commit logs
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit log\fR [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\-\-] <path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows the commit logs\&.
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the \fBgit rev\-list\fR command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the \fBgit diff\-*\fR commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-follow
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-decorate, \-\-decorate[=short|full|auto|no]
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\&. If
\fIshort\fR
is specified, the ref name prefixes
\fIrefs/heads/\fR,
\fIrefs/tags/\fR
and
\fIrefs/remotes/\fR
will not be printed\&. If
\fIfull\fR
is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed\&. If
\fIauto\fR
is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref names are shown as if
\fIshort\fR
were given, otherwise no ref names are shown\&. The default option is
\fIshort\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-decorate\-refs=<pattern>, \-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude=<pattern>
.RS 4
If no
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR
is given, pretend as if all refs were included\&. For each candidate, do not use it for decoration if it matches any patterns given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\-exclude\fR
or if it doesn\(cqt match any of the patterns given to
\fB\-\-decorate\-refs\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-source
.RS 4
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-mailmap
.RS 4
Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses\&. See
\fBgit-shortlog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-diff
.RS 4
Without this flag,
\fBgit log \-p <path>\&.\&.\&.\fR
shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\&. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "<path>\&..." limits only commits, and doesn\(cqt limit diff for those commits\&.
.sp
Note that this affects all diff\-based output types, e\&.g\&. those produced by
\fB\-\-stat\fR, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-size
.RS 4
Include a line \(lqlog size <number>\(rq in the output for each commit, where <number> is the length of that commit\(cqs message in bytes\&. Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from
\fBgit log\fR
output by allowing them to allocate space in advance\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L <start>,<end>:<file>, \-L :<funcname>:<file>
.RS 4
Trace the evolution of the line range given by "<start>,<end>" (or the function name regex <funcname>) within the <file>\&. You may not give any pathspec limiters\&. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i\&.e\&., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments\&. You can specify this option more than once\&.
.sp
<start> and <end> can take one of these forms:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
number
.sp
If <start> or <end> is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
/regex/
.sp
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex\&. If <start> is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. If <start> is \(lq^/regex/\(rq, it will search from the start of file\&. If <end> is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
+offset or \-offset
.sp
This is only valid for <end> and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
If \(lq:<funcname>\(rq is given in place of <start> and <end>, it is a regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches <funcname>, up to the next funcname line\&. \(lq:<funcname>\(rq searches from the end of the previous
\fB\-L\fR
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. \(lq^:<funcname>\(rq searches from the start of file\&.
.RE
.PP
<revision range>
.RS 4
Show only commits in the specified revision range\&. When no <revision range> is specified, it defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR
(i\&.e\&. the whole history leading to the current commit)\&.
\fBorigin\&.\&.HEAD\fR
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit (i\&.e\&.
\fBHEAD\fR), but not from
\fBorigin\fR\&. For a complete list of ways to spell <revision range>, see the
\fISpecifying Ranges\fR
section of
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
[\-\-] <path>\&...
.RS 4
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&. See
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below for details and other simplification modes\&.
.sp
Paths may need to be prefixed with \(oq`\-\- \(aq\(cq to separate them from options or the revision range, when confusion arises\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-since=<date1>\fR limits to commits newer than \fB<date1>\fR, and using it with \fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches \fB<pattern>\fR), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fB\-\-reverse\fR\&.
.PP
\-<number>, \-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-author=<pattern>\fR, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
\fB\-\-committer=<pattern>\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep\-reflog=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep\-reflog\fR, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR, commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
\fB\-\-all\-match\fR)\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-show\-notes\fR
is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\fB\-\-grep\fR, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-invert\-grep
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not match the pattern specified with
\fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P, \-\-perl\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl\-compatible regular expressions\&.
.sp
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional compile\-time dependency\&. If Git wasn\(cqt compiled with support for them providing this option will cause it to die\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merges
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-min\-parents=<number>, \-\-max\-parents=<number>, \-\-no\-min\-parents, \-\-no\-max\-parents
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits\&. In particular,
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR,
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-merges\fR\&.
\fB\-\-max\-parents=0\fR
gives all root commits and
\fB\-\-min\-parents=3\fR
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-min\-parents\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-max\-parents\fR
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\fB\-\-min\-parents=0\fR
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\fB\-\-max\-parents=\-1\fR
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&. Cannot be combined with \-\-bisect\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-mark
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
(see below) but mark equivalent commits with
\fB=\fR
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
\fB+\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the \(lqother side\(rq when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
(see the example below in the description of the
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
option)\&. However, it shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, \(lq3rd on b\(rq may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-only, \-\-right\-only
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked
\fB<\fR
resp\&.
\fB>\fR
by
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR\&.
.sp
For example,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only A\&.\&.\&.B\fR
omits those commits from
\fBB\fR
which are in
\fBA\fR
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
\fBA\fR\&. In other words, this lists the
\fB+\fR
commits from
\fBgit cherry A B\fR\&. More precisely,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only \-\-no\-merges\fR
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry
.RS 4
A synonym for
\fB\-\-right\-only \-\-cherry\-mark \-\-no\-merges\fR; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
\fBgit log \-\-cherry upstream\&.\&.\&.mybranch\fR, similar to
\fBgit cherry upstream mybranch\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fI^commit\fR,
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR, and
\fIcommit1\&.\&.\&.commit2\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-pretty\fR
format other than
\fBoneline\fR
(for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. The reflog designator in the output may be shown as
\fBref@{Nth}\fR
(where
\fBNth\fR
is the reverse\-chronological index in the reflog) or as
\fBref@{timestamp}\fR
(with the timestamp for that entry), depending on a few rules:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c

Otherwise, show the index format\&.
.RE
.sp
Under
\fB\-\-pretty=oneline\fR, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\&. This option cannot be combined with
\fB\-\-reverse\fR\&. See also
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.

.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.

.PP
<paths>

Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration
.RS 4
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected\&.
.RE

The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
Default mode

\fBrev\-list\fR walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \fB\-\-full\-history\fR and/or parent rewriting (via \fB\-\-parents\fR or \fB\-\-children\fR) are used\&. The following settings are available\&.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see

This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get

\-\-show\-linear\-break[=<barrier>]
.RS 4
When \-\-graph is not used, all history branches are flattened which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do not belong to a linear branch\&. This option puts a barrier in between them in that case\&. If
\fB<barrier>\fR
is specified, it is the string that will be shown instead of the default one\&.
.RE
.SS "Diff Formatting"
.sp
Listed below are options that control the formatting of diff output\&. Some of them are specific to \fBgit-rev-list\fR(1), however other diff options may be given\&. See \fBgit-diff-files\fR(1) for more options\&.
.PP
\-c
.RS 4
With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a time\&. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cc
.RS 4
This flag implies the
\fB\-c\fR
option and further compresses the patch output by omitting uninteresting hunks whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge result picks one of them without modification\&.
.RE
.PP
\-m
.RS 4
This flag makes the merge commits show the full diff like regular commits; for each merge parent, a separate log entry and diff is generated\&. An exception is that only diff against the first parent is shown when
\fB\-\-first\-parent\fR
option is given; in that case, the output represents the changes the merge brought
\fIinto\fR
the then\-current branch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-r
.RS 4
Show recursive diffs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
Show the tree objects in the diff output\&. This implies
\fB\-r\fR\&.

.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
.sp
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\&. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\&. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\&.
.sp
There are several built\-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty\&.<name> config option to either another format name, or a \fIformat:\fR string, as described below (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. Here are the details of the built\-in formats:

\fIraw\fR
.sp
The
\fIraw\fR
format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\&. Notably, the SHA\-1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and
\fIparents\fR
information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into account\&. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e\&.g\&. with
\fBgit log \-\-raw\fR\&. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
\fB\-\-no\-abbrev\fR\&.

\fIformat:<string>\fR

The
\fIformat:<string>\fR
format allows you to specify which information you want to show\&. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
\fI%n\fR
instead of
\fI\en\fR\&.
.sp
E\&.g,
\fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR

\fItformat:\fR

The

format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp

It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fBm\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.

.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fBn\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.

If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see

A \fB\-\fR character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&.

In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \fB\-\fR removals from both file1 and file2, plus \fB++\fR to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&.
