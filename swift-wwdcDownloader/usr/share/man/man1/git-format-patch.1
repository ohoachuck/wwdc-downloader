.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Prepare each commit with its patch in one file per commit, formatted to resemble UNIX mailbox format\&. The output of this command is convenient for e\-mail submission or for use with \fIgit am\fR\&.
.sp
There are two ways to specify which commits to operate on\&.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
A single commit, <since>, specifies that the commits leading to the tip of the current branch that are not in the history that leads to the <since> to be output\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
Generic <revision range> expression (see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)) means the commits in the specified range\&.
.RE
.sp
The first rule takes precedence in the case of a single <commit>\&. To apply the second rule, i\&.e\&., format everything since the beginning of history up until <commit>, use the \fI\-\-root\fR option: \fBgit format\-patch \-\-root <commit>\fR\&. If you want to format only <commit> itself, you can do this with \fBgit format\-patch \-1 <commit>\fR\&.
.sp
By default, each output file is numbered sequentially from 1, and uses the first line of the commit message (massaged for pathname safety) as the filename\&. With the \fB\-\-numbered\-files\fR option, the output file names will only be numbers, without the first line of the commit appended\&. The names of the output files are printed to standard output, unless the \fB\-\-stdout\fR option is specified\&.
.sp
If \fB\-o\fR is specified, output files are created in <dir>\&. Otherwise they are created in the current working directory\&. The default path can be set with the \fBformat\&.outputDirectory\fR configuration option\&. The \fB\-o\fR option takes precedence over \fBformat\&.outputDirectory\fR\&. To store patches in the current working directory even when \fBformat\&.outputDirectory\fR points elsewhere, use \fB\-o \&.\fR\&.
.sp
By default, the subject of a single patch is "[PATCH] " followed by the concatenation of lines from the commit message up to the first blank line (see the DISCUSSION section of \fBgit-commit\fR(1))\&.
.sp
When multiple patches are output, the subject prefix will instead be "[PATCH n/m] "\&. To force 1/1 to be added for a single patch, use \fB\-n\fR\&. To omit patch numbers from the subject, use \fB\-N\fR\&.
.sp
If given \fB\-\-thread\fR, \fBgit\-format\-patch\fR will generate \fBIn\-Reply\-To\fR and \fBReferences\fR headers to make the second and subsequent patch mails appear as replies to the first mail; this also generates a \fBMessage\-Id\fR header to reference\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-p, \-\-no\-stat
.RS 4
Generate plain patches without any diffstats\&.
.RE
.PP
\-U<n>, \-\-unified=<n>
.RS 4
Generate diffs with <n> lines of context instead of the usual three\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-indent\-heuristic
.RS 4
Enable the heuristic that shift diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to read\&. This is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-indent\-heuristic
.RS 4
Disable the indent heuristic\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-minimal
.RS 4
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-patience
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "patience diff" algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-histogram
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "histogram diff" algorithm\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-anchored=<text>
.RS 4
Generate a diff using the "anchored diff" algorithm\&.
.sp
This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from appearing as a deletion or addition in the output\&. It uses the "patience diff" algorithm internally\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diff\-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}
.RS 4
Choose a diff algorithm\&. The variants are as follows:
.PP
\fBdefault\fR, \fBmyers\fR
.RS 4
The basic greedy diff algorithm\&. Currently, this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBminimal\fR
.RS 4
Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpatience\fR
.RS 4
Use "patience diff" algorithm when generating patches\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBhistogram\fR
.RS 4
This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to "support low\-occurrence common elements"\&.
.RE
.sp
For instance, if you configured diff\&.algorithm variable to a non\-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
\fB\-\-diff\-algorithm=default\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stat[=<width>[,<name\-width>[,<count>]]]
.RS 4
Generate a diffstat\&. By default, as much space as necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part\&. Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a terminal, and can be overridden by
\fB<width>\fR\&. The width of the filename part can be limited by giving another width
\fB<name\-width>\fR
after a comma\&. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
\fB\-\-stat\-graph\-width=<width>\fR
(affects all commands generating a stat graph) or by setting
\fBdiff\&.statGraphWidth=<width>\fR
(does not affect
\fBgit format\-patch\fR)\&. By giving a third parameter
\fB<count>\fR, you can limit the output to the first
\fB<count>\fR
lines, followed by
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR
if there are more\&.
.sp
These parameters can also be set individually with
\fB\-\-stat\-width=<width>\fR,
\fB\-\-stat\-name\-width=<name\-width>\fR
and
\fB\-\-stat\-count=<count>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-compact\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file creations or deletions ("new" or "gone", optionally "+l" if it\(cqs a symlink) and mode changes ("+x" or "\-x" for adding or removing executable bit respectively) in diffstat\&. The information is put betwen the filename part and the graph part\&. Implies
\fB\-\-stat\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-numstat
.RS 4
Similar to
\fB\-\-stat\fR, but shows number of added and deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly\&. For binary files, outputs two
\fB\-\fR
instead of saying
\fB0 0\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-shortstat
.RS 4
Output only the last line of the
\fB\-\-stat\fR
format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dirstat[=<param1,param2,\&...>]
.RS 4
Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for each sub\-directory\&. The behavior of
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
can be customized by passing it a comma separated list of parameters\&. The defaults are controlled by the
\fBdiff\&.dirstat\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. The following parameters are available:
.PP
\fBchanges\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination\&. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file\&. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes\&. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlines\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior than the
\fBchanges\fR
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes\&. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other
\fB\-\-*stat\fR
options\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfiles\fR
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed\&. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis\&. This is the computationally cheapest
\fB\-\-dirstat\fR
behavior, since it does not have to look at the file contents at all\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBcumulative\fR
.RS 4
Count changes in a child directory for the parent directory as well\&. Note that when using
\fBcumulative\fR, the sum of the percentages reported may exceed 100%\&. The default (non\-cumulative) behavior can be specified with the
\fBnoncumulative\fR
parameter\&.
.RE
.PP
<limit>
.RS 4
An integer parameter specifies a cut\-off percent (3% by default)\&. Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes are not shown in the output\&.
.RE
.sp
Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
\fB\-\-dirstat=files,10,cumulative\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-summary
.RS 4
Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-renames
.RS 4
Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration file gives the default to do so\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-index
.RS 4
Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full pre\- and post\-image blob object names on the "index" line when generating patch format output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-binary
.RS 4
In addition to
\fB\-\-full\-index\fR, output a binary diff that can be applied with
\fBgit\-apply\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object name in diff\-raw format output and diff\-tree header lines, show only a partial prefix\&. This is independent of the
\fB\-\-full\-index\fR
option above, which controls the diff\-patch output format\&. Non default number of digits can be specified with
\fB\-\-abbrev=<n>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-B[<n>][/<m>], \-\-break\-rewrites[=[<n>][/<m>]]
.RS 4
Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
\fBm\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\fB\-B/70%\fR
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
\fBn\fR
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.
\fB\-B20%\fR
specifies that a change with addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file\(cqs size are eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-M[<n>], \-\-find\-renames[=<n>]
.RS 4
Detect renames\&. If
\fBn\fR
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\fB\-M90%\fR
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
\fB%\fR
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\fB\-M5\fR
becomes 0\&.5, and is thus the same as
\fB\-M50%\fR\&. Similarly,
\fB\-M05\fR
is the same as
\fB\-M5%\fR\&. To limit detection to exact renames, use
\fB\-M100%\fR\&. The default similarity index is 50%\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C[<n>], \-\-find\-copies[=<n>]
.RS 4
Detect copies as well as renames\&. See also
\fB\-\-find\-copies\-harder\fR\&. If
\fBn\fR
is specified, it has the same meaning as for
\fB\-M<n>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-find\-copies\-harder
.RS 4
For performance reasons, by default,
\fB\-C\fR
option finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same changeset\&. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates for the source of copy\&. This is a very expensive operation for large projects, so use it with caution\&. Giving more than one
\fB\-C\fR
option has the same effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\-D, \-\-irreversible\-delete
.RS 4
Omit the preimage for deletes, i\&.e\&. print only the header but not the diff between the preimage and
\fB/dev/null\fR\&. The resulting patch is not meant to be applied with
\fBpatch\fR
or
\fBgit apply\fR; this is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after the change\&. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option\&.
.sp
When used together with
\fB\-B\fR, omit also the preimage in the deletion part of a delete/create pair\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l<num>
.RS 4
The
\fB\-M\fR
and
\fB\-C\fR
options require O(n^2) processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets\&. This option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number\&.
.RE
.PP
\-O<orderfile>
.RS 4
Control the order in which files appear in the output\&. This overrides the
\fBdiff\&.orderFile\fR
configuration variable (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. To cancel
\fBdiff\&.orderFile\fR, use
\fB\-O/dev/null\fR\&.
.sp
The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in <orderfile>\&. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but not the first) are output next, and so on\&. All files with pathnames that do not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match\-all pattern at the end of the file\&. If multiple pathnames have the same rank (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their output order relative to each other is the normal order\&.
.sp
<orderfile> is parsed as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as separators for readability\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Lines starting with a hash ("\fB#\fR") are ignored, so they can be used for comments\&. Add a backslash ("\fB\e\fR") to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a hash\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Each other line contains a single pattern\&.
.RE
.sp
Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for fnmantch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches a pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components matches the pattern\&. For example, the pattern "\fBfoo*bar\fR" matches "\fBfooasdfbar\fR" and "\fBfoo/bar/baz/asdf\fR" but not "\fBfoobarx\fR"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-a, \-\-text
.RS 4
Treat all files as text\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-cr\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore carrige\-return at the end of line when doing a comparison\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-space\-at\-eol
.RS 4
Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL\&.
.RE
.PP
\-b, \-\-ignore\-space\-change
.RS 4
Ignore changes in amount of whitespace\&. This ignores whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more whitespace characters to be equivalent\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w, \-\-ignore\-all\-space
.RS 4
Ignore whitespace when comparing lines\&. This ignores differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has none\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-blank\-lines
.RS 4
Ignore changes whose lines are all blank\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-inter\-hunk\-context=<lines>
.RS 4
Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other\&. Defaults to
\fBdiff\&.interHunkContext\fR
or 0 if the config option is unset\&.
.RE
.PP
\-W, \-\-function\-context
.RS 4
Show whole surrounding functions of changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Allow an external diff helper to be executed\&. If you set an external diff driver with
\fBgitattributes\fR(5), you need to use this option with
\fBgit-log\fR(1)
and friends\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-ext\-diff
.RS 4
Disallow external diff drivers\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-textconv, \-\-no\-textconv
.RS 4
Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to be run when comparing binary files\&. See
\fBgitattributes\fR(5)
for details\&. Because textconv filters are typically a one\-way conversion, the resulting diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied\&. For this reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for
\fBgit-diff\fR(1)
and
\fBgit-log\fR(1), but not for
\fBgit-format-patch\fR(1)
or diff plumbing commands\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-submodules[=<when>]
.RS 4
Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation\&. <when> can be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default\&. Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the
\fIignore\fR
option in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
or
\fBgitmodules\fR(5)\&. When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content)\&. Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior until 1\&.7\&.0)\&. Using "all" hides all changes to submodules\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\-\-ita\-invisible\-in\-index
.RS 4
By default entries added by "git add \-N" appear as an existing empty file in "git diff" and a new file in "git diff \-\-cached"\&. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in "git diff" and non\-existent in "git diff \-\-cached"\&. This option could be reverted with
\fB\-\-ita\-visible\-in\-index\fR\&. Both options are experimental and could be removed in future\&.
.RE

\fIdeep\fR
threading makes every mail a reply to the previous one\&.
.sp
The default is
\fB\-\-no\-thread\fR, unless the

\fB\-\-thread\fR
is specified without a style, it defaults to the style specified by
\fBformat\&.thread\fR

\fBshallow\fR\&.
.sp
Beware that the default for
\fIgit send\-email\fR

Typically it will be placed in a MUA\(cqs drafts folder, edited to add timely commentary that should not go in the changelog after the three dashes, and then sent as a message whose body, in our example, starts with "arch/arm config files were\&..."\&. On the receiving end, readers can save interesting patches in a UNIX mailbox and apply them with \fBgit-am\fR(1)\&.
.sp
When a patch is part of an ongoing discussion, the patch generated by \fIgit format\-patch\fR can be tweaked to take advantage of the \fIgit am \-\-scissors\fR feature\&. After your response to the discussion comes a line that consists solely of "\fB\-\- >8 \-\-\fR" (scissors and perforation), followed by the patch with unnecessary header fields removed:

When sending a patch this way, most often you are sending your own patch, so in addition to the "\fBFrom $SHA1 $magic_timestamp\fR" marker you should omit \fBFrom:\fR and \fBDate:\fR lines from the patch file\&. The patch title is likely to be different from the subject of the discussion the patch is in response to, so it is likely that you would want to keep the Subject: line, like the example above\&.

\fIfinal\-commit\fR

\fIfinal\-commit\fR

Here are some hints on how to successfully submit patches inline using various mailers\&.
.SS "GMail"

GMail does not have any way to turn off line wrapping in the web interface, so it will mangle any emails that you send\&. You can however use "git send\-email" and send your patches through the GMail SMTP server, or use any IMAP email client to connect to the google IMAP server and forward the emails through that\&.
