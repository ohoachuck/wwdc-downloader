.SH "NAME"
git-check-ignore \- Debug gitignore / exclude files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit check\-ignore\fR [options] pathname\&...
\fIgit check\-ignore\fR [options] \-\-stdin
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
For each pathname given via the command\-line or from a file via \fB\-\-stdin\fR, check whether the file is excluded by \&.gitignore (or other input files to the exclude mechanism) and output the path if it is excluded\&.
.sp
By default, tracked files are not shown at all since they are not subject to exclude rules; but see \(oq\-\-no\-index\(cq\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Don\(cqt output anything, just set exit status\&. This is only valid with a single pathname\&.
.RE
.PP
\-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 4
Also output details about the matching pattern (if any) for each given pathname\&. For precedence rules within and between exclude sources, see
\fBgitignore\fR(5)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
Read pathnames from the standard input, one per line, instead of from the command\-line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
The output format is modified to be machine\-parseable (see below)\&. If
\fB\-\-stdin\fR
is also given, input paths are separated with a NUL character instead of a linefeed character\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-non\-matching
.RS 4
Show given paths which don\(cqt match any pattern\&. This only makes sense when
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
is enabled, otherwise it would not be possible to distinguish between paths which match a pattern and those which don\(cqt\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-index
.RS 4
Don\(cqt look in the index when undertaking the checks\&. This can be used to debug why a path became tracked by e\&.g\&.
\fBgit add \&.\fR
and was not ignored by the rules as expected by the user or when developing patterns including negation to match a path previously added with
\fBgit add \-f\fR\&.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT"
.sp
By default, any of the given pathnames which match an ignore pattern will be output, one per line\&. If no pattern matches a given path, nothing will be output for that path; this means that path will not be ignored\&.
.sp
If \fB\-\-verbose\fR is specified, the output is a series of lines of the form:
.sp
<source> <COLON> <linenum> <COLON> <pattern> <HT> <pathname>
.sp
<pathname> is the path of a file being queried, <pattern> is the matching pattern, <source> is the pattern\(cqs source file, and <linenum> is the line number of the pattern within that source\&. If the pattern contained a \fB!\fR prefix or \fB/\fR suffix, it will be preserved in the output\&. <source> will be an absolute path when referring to the file configured by \fBcore\&.excludesFile\fR, or relative to the repository root when referring to \fB\&.git/info/exclude\fR or a per\-directory exclude file\&.
.sp
If \fB\-z\fR is specified, the pathnames in the output are delimited by the null character; if \fB\-\-verbose\fR is also specified then null characters are also used instead of colons and hard tabs:
.sp
<source> <NULL> <linenum> <NULL> <pattern> <NULL> <pathname> <NULL>
.sp
If \fB\-n\fR or \fB\-\-non\-matching\fR are specified, non\-matching pathnames will also be output, in which case all fields in each output record except for <pathname> will be empty\&. This can be useful when running non\-interactively, so that files can be incrementally streamed to STDIN of a long\-running check\-ignore process, and for each of these files, STDOUT will indicate whether that file matched a pattern or not\&. (Without this option, it would be impossible to tell whether the absence of output for a given file meant that it didn\(cqt match any pattern, or that the output hadn\(cqt been generated yet\&.)
.sp
Buffering happens as documented under the \fBGIT_FLUSH\fR option in \fBgit\fR(1)\&. The caller is responsible for avoiding deadlocks caused by overfilling an input buffer or reading from an empty output buffer\&.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
0
.RS 4
One or more of the provided paths is ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
1
.RS 4
None of the provided paths are ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
128
.RS 4
A fatal error was encountered\&.
