.SH "NAME"
git-svn \- Bidirectional operation between a Subversion repository and Git
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit svn\fR <command> [options] [arguments]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fIgit svn\fR is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and Git\&. It provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a Subversion and a Git repository\&.
.sp
\fIgit svn\fR can track a standard Subversion repository, following the common "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the \-\-stdlayout option\&. It can also follow branches and tags in any layout with the \-T/\-t/\-b options (see options to \fIinit\fR below, and also the \fIclone\fR command)\&.
.sp
Once tracking a Subversion repository (with any of the above methods), the Git repository can be updated from Subversion by the \fIfetch\fR command and Subversion updated from Git by the \fIdcommit\fR command\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
\fIinit\fR
.RS 4
Initializes an empty Git repository with additional metadata directories for
\fIgit svn\fR\&. The Subversion URL may be specified as a command\-line argument, or as full URL arguments to \-T/\-t/\-b\&. Optionally, the target directory to operate on can be specified as a second argument\&. Normally this command initializes the current directory\&.
.PP
\-T<trunk_subdir>, \-\-trunk=<trunk_subdir>, \-t<tags_subdir>, \-\-tags=<tags_subdir>, \-b<branches_subdir>, \-\-branches=<branches_subdir>, \-s, \-\-stdlayout
.RS 4
These are optional command\-line options for init\&. Each of these flags can point to a relative repository path (\-\-tags=project/tags) or a full url (\-\-tags=https://foo\&.org/project/tags)\&. You can specify more than one \-\-tags and/or \-\-branches options, in case your Subversion repository places tags or branches under multiple paths\&. The option \-\-stdlayout is a shorthand way of setting trunk,tags,branches as the relative paths, which is the Subversion default\&. If any of the other options are given as well, they take precedence\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-metadata
.RS 4
Set the
\fInoMetadata\fR
option in the [svn\-remote] config\&. This option is not recommended, please read the
\fIsvn\&.noMetadata\fR
section of this manpage before using this option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-svm\-props
.RS 4
Set the
\fIuseSvmProps\fR
option in the [svn\-remote] config\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-svnsync\-props
.RS 4
Set the
\fIuseSvnsyncProps\fR
option in the [svn\-remote] config\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rewrite\-root=<URL>
.RS 4
Set the
\fIrewriteRoot\fR
option in the [svn\-remote] config\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rewrite\-uuid=<UUID>
.RS 4
Set the
\fIrewriteUUID\fR
option in the [svn\-remote] config\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-username=<user>
.RS 4
For transports that SVN handles authentication for (http, https, and plain svn), specify the username\&. For other transports (e\&.g\&.
\fBsvn+ssh://\fR), you must include the username in the URL, e\&.g\&.
\fBsvn+ssh://foo@svn\&.bar\&.com/project\fR
.RE
.PP
\-\-prefix=<prefix>
.RS 4
This allows one to specify a prefix which is prepended to the names of remotes if trunk/branches/tags are specified\&. The prefix does not automatically include a trailing slash, so be sure you include one in the argument if that is what you want\&. If \-\-branches/\-b is specified, the prefix must include a trailing slash\&. Setting a prefix (with a trailing slash) is strongly encouraged in any case, as your SVN\-tracking refs will then be located at "refs/remotes/$prefix/\fB", which is compatible with Git\(cqs own remote\-tracking ref layout (refs/remotes/$remote/\fR)\&. Setting a prefix is also useful if you wish to track multiple projects that share a common repository\&. By default, the prefix is set to
\fIorigin/\fR\&.

.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
Before Git v2\&.0, the default prefix was "" (no prefix)\&. This meant that SVN\-tracking refs were put at "refs/remotes/*", which is incompatible with how Git\(cqs own remote\-tracking refs are organized\&. If you still want the old default, you can get it by passing
\fB\-\-prefix ""\fR
on the command line (\fB\-\-prefix=""\fR
may not work if your Perl\(cqs Getopt::Long is < v2\&.37)\&.

.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-minimize\-url
.RS 4
When tracking multiple directories (using \-\-stdlayout, \-\-branches, or \-\-tags options), git svn will attempt to connect to the root (or highest allowed level) of the Subversion repository\&. This default allows better tracking of history if entire projects are moved within a repository, but may cause issues on repositories where read access restrictions are in place\&. Passing
\fB\-\-no\-minimize\-url\fR
will allow git svn to accept URLs as\-is without attempting to connect to a higher level directory\&. This option is off by default when only one URL/branch is tracked (it would do little good)\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIfetch\fR
.RS 4
Fetch unfetched revisions from the Subversion remote we are tracking\&. The name of the [svn\-remote "\&..."] section in the $GIT_DIR/config file may be specified as an optional command\-line argument\&.
.sp
This automatically updates the rev_map if needed (see
\fI$GIT_DIR/svn/**/\&.rev_map\&.*\fR
in the FILES section below for details)\&.
.PP
\-\-localtime
.RS 4
Store Git commit times in the local time zone instead of UTC\&. This makes
\fIgit log\fR
(even without \-\-date=local) show the same times that
\fBsvn log\fR
would in the local time zone\&.
.sp
This doesn\(cqt interfere with interoperating with the Subversion repository you cloned from, but if you wish for your local Git repository to be able to interoperate with someone else\(cqs local Git repository, either don\(cqt use this option or you should both use it in the same local time zone\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-parent
.RS 4
Fetch only from the SVN parent of the current HEAD\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-refs=<regex>
.RS 4
Ignore refs for branches or tags matching the Perl regular expression\&. A "negative look\-ahead assertion" like
\fB^refs/remotes/origin/(?!tags/wanted\-tag|wanted\-branch)\&.*$\fR
can be used to allow only certain refs\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
config key: svn\-remote\&.<name>\&.ignore\-refs
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the ignore\-refs configuration key is set, and the command\-line option is also given, both regular expressions will be used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-paths=<regex>
.RS 4
This allows one to specify a Perl regular expression that will cause skipping of all matching paths from checkout from SVN\&. The
\fB\-\-ignore\-paths\fR
option should match for every
\fIfetch\fR
(including automatic fetches due to
\fIclone\fR,
\fIdcommit\fR,
\fIrebase\fR, etc) on a given repository\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
config key: svn\-remote\&.<name>\&.ignore\-paths
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the ignore\-paths configuration key is set, and the command\-line option is also given, both regular expressions will be used\&.
.sp
Examples:
.PP
Skip "doc*" directory for every fetch
.RS 4
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
\-\-ignore\-paths="^doc"

option should match for every
\fIfetch\fR
(including automatic fetches due to
\fIclone\fR,
\fIdcommit\fR,
\fIrebase\fR, etc) on a given repository\&.
\fB\-\-ignore\-paths\fR
takes precedence over
\fB\-\-include\-paths\fR\&.

.sp
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-window\-size=<n>
.RS 4
Fetch <n> log entries per request when scanning Subversion history\&. The default is 100\&. For very large Subversion repositories, larger values may be needed for
\fIclone\fR/\fIfetch\fR
to complete in reasonable time\&. But overly large values may lead to higher memory usage and request timeouts\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIclone\fR
.RS 4
Runs
\fIinit\fR
and
\fIfetch\fR\&. It will automatically create a directory based on the basename of the URL passed to it; or if a second argument is passed; it will create a directory and work within that\&. It accepts all arguments that the
\fIinit\fR
and
\fIfetch\fR
commands accept; with the exception of
\fB\-\-fetch\-all\fR
and
\fB\-\-parent\fR\&. After a repository is cloned, the
\fIfetch\fR
command will be able to update revisions without affecting the working tree; and the
\fIrebase\fR
command will be able to update the working tree with the latest changes\&.
.PP
\-\-preserve\-empty\-dirs
.RS 4
Create a placeholder file in the local Git repository for each empty directory fetched from Subversion\&. This includes directories that become empty by removing all entries in the Subversion repository (but not the directory itself)\&. The placeholder files are also tracked and removed when no longer necessary\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-placeholder\-filename=<filename>
.RS 4
Set the name of placeholder files created by \-\-preserve\-empty\-dirs\&. Default: "\&.gitignore"
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIrebase\fR
.RS 4
This fetches revisions from the SVN parent of the current HEAD and rebases the current (uncommitted to SVN) work against it\&.
.sp
This works similarly to
\fBsvn update\fR
or
\fIgit pull\fR
except that it preserves linear history with
\fIgit rebase\fR
instead of
\fIgit merge\fR
for ease of dcommitting with
\fIgit svn\fR\&.
.sp
This accepts all options that
\fIgit svn fetch\fR
and
\fIgit rebase\fR
accept\&. However,
\fB\-\-fetch\-all\fR
only fetches from the current [svn\-remote], and not all [svn\-remote] definitions\&.
.sp
Like
\fIgit rebase\fR; this requires that the working tree be clean and have no uncommitted changes\&.
.sp
This automatically updates the rev_map if needed (see
\fI$GIT_DIR/svn/**/\&.rev_map\&.*\fR
in the FILES section below for details)\&.
.PP
\-l, \-\-local
.RS 4
Do not fetch remotely; only run
\fIgit rebase\fR
against the last fetched commit from the upstream SVN\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fIdcommit\fR
.RS 4
Commit each diff from the current branch directly to the SVN repository, and then rebase or reset (depending on whether or not there is a diff between SVN and head)\&. This will create a revision in SVN for each commit in Git\&.
.sp
When an optional Git branch name (or a Git commit object name) is specified as an argument, the subcommand works on the specified branch, not on the current branch\&.
.sp
Use of
\fIdcommit\fR
is preferred to
\fIset\-tree\fR
(below)\&.
.PP
\-\-no\-rebase
.RS 4
After committing, do not rebase or reset\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-commit\-url <URL>
.RS 4
Commit to this SVN URL (the full path)\&. This is intended to allow existing
\fIgit svn\fR
repositories created with one transport method (e\&.g\&.
\fBsvn://\fR
or
\fBhttp://\fR
for anonymous read) to be reused if a user is later given access to an alternate transport method (e\&.g\&.
\fBsvn+ssh://\fR
or
\fBhttps://\fR) for commit\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
config key: svn\-remote\&.<name>\&.commiturl
config key: svn\&.commiturl (overwrites all svn\-remote\&.<name>\&.commiturl options)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note that the SVN URL of the commiturl config key includes the SVN branch\&. If you rather want to set the commit URL for an entire SVN repository use svn\-remote\&.<name>\&.pushurl instead\&.
.sp
Using this option for any other purpose (don\(cqt ask) is very strongly discouraged\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-mergeinfo=<mergeinfo>
.RS 4
Add the given merge information during the dcommit (e\&.g\&.
\fB\-\-mergeinfo="/branches/foo:1\-10"\fR)\&. All svn server versions can store this information (as a property), and svn clients starting from version 1\&.5 can make use of it\&. To specify merge information from multiple branches, use a single space character between the branches (\fB\-\-mergeinfo="/branches/foo:1\-10 /branches/bar:3,5\-6,8"\fR)
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
config key: svn\&.pushmergeinfo
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This option will cause git\-svn to attempt to automatically populate the svn:mergeinfo property in the SVN repository when possible\&. Currently, this can only be done when dcommitting non\-fast\-forward merges where all parents but the first have already been pushed into SVN\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-interactive
.RS 4
Ask the user to confirm that a patch set should actually be sent to SVN\&. For each patch, one may answer "yes" (accept this patch), "no" (discard this patch), "all" (accept all patches), or "quit"\&.
.sp
\fIgit svn dcommit\fR
returns immediately if answer is "no" or "quit", without committing anything to SVN\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP

.PP
\-m, \-\-message

command, you must provide the location of the branch (or tag) you wish to create in the SVN repository\&. <path> specifies which path to use to create the branch or tag and should match the pattern on the left\-hand side of one of the configured branches or tags refspecs\&. You can see these refspecs with the commands
.sp
.if n \{\

.RS 4
Attempts to recreate empty directories that core Git cannot track based on information in $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>/unhandled\&.log files\&. Empty directories are automatically recreated when using "git svn clone" and "git svn rebase", so "mkdirs" is intended for use after commands like "git checkout" or "git reset"\&.

\fIcommit\-diff\fR
.RS 4
Commits the diff of two tree\-ish arguments from the command\-line\&. This command does not rely on being inside an
\fBgit svn init\fR\-ed repository\&. This command takes three arguments, (a) the original tree to diff against, (b) the new tree result, (c) the URL of the target Subversion repository\&. The final argument (URL) may be omitted if you are working from a
\fIgit svn\fR\-aware repository (that has been

\fIreset\fR
.RS 4
Undoes the effects of
\fIfetch\fR
back to the specified revision\&. This allows you to re\-\fIfetch\fR
an SVN revision\&. Normally the contents of an SVN revision should never change and
\fIreset\fR
should not be necessary\&. However, if SVN permissions change, or if you alter your \-\-ignore\-paths option, a
\fIfetch\fR
may fail with "not found in commit" (file not previously visible) or "checksum mismatch" (missed a modification)\&. If the problem file cannot be ignored forever (with \-\-ignore\-paths) the only way to repair the repo is to use
\fIreset\fR\&.
.sp
Only the rev_map and refs/remotes/git\-svn are changed (see
\fI$GIT_DIR/svn/**/\&.rev_map\&.*\fR
in the FILES section below for details)\&. Follow
\fIreset\fR
with a
\fIfetch\fR

.SH "REBASE VS\&. PULL/MERGE"
.sp
Prefer to use \fIgit svn rebase\fR or \fIgit rebase\fR, rather than \fIgit pull\fR or \fIgit merge\fR to synchronize unintegrated commits with a \fIgit svn\fR branch\&. Doing so will keep the history of unintegrated commits linear with respect to the upstream SVN repository and allow the use of the preferred \fIgit svn dcommit\fR subcommand to push unintegrated commits back into SVN\&.
.sp
Originally, \fIgit svn\fR recommended that developers pulled or merged from the \fIgit svn\fR branch\&. This was because the author favored \fBgit svn set\-tree B\fR to commit a single head rather than the \fBgit svn set\-tree A\&.\&.B\fR notation to commit multiple commits\&. Use of \fIgit pull\fR or \fIgit merge\fR with \fBgit svn set\-tree A\&.\&.B\fR will cause non\-linear history to be flattened when committing into SVN and this can lead to merge commits unexpectedly reversing previous commits in SVN\&.
.SH "MERGE TRACKING"
.sp
While \fIgit svn\fR can track copy history (including branches and tags) for repositories adopting a standard layout, it cannot yet represent merge history that happened inside git back upstream to SVN users\&. Therefore it is advised that users keep history as linear as possible inside Git to ease compatibility with SVN (see the CAVEATS section below)\&.
.SH "HANDLING OF SVN BRANCHES"
.sp
If \fIgit svn\fR is configured to fetch branches (and \-\-follow\-branches is in effect), it sometimes creates multiple Git branches for one SVN branch, where the additional branches have names of the form \fIbranchname@nnn\fR (with nnn an SVN revision number)\&. These additional branches are created if \fIgit svn\fR cannot find a parent commit for the first commit in an SVN branch, to connect the branch to the history of the other branches\&.
.sp
Normally, the first commit in an SVN branch consists of a copy operation\&. \fIgit svn\fR will read this commit to get the SVN revision the branch was created from\&. It will then try to find the Git commit that corresponds to this SVN revision, and use that as the parent of the branch\&. However, it is possible that there is no suitable Git commit to serve as parent\&. This will happen, among other reasons, if the SVN branch is a copy of a revision that was not fetched by \fIgit svn\fR (e\&.g\&. because it is an old revision that was skipped with \fB\-\-revision\fR), or if in SVN a directory was copied that is not tracked by \fIgit svn\fR (such as a branch that is not tracked at all, or a subdirectory of a tracked branch)\&. In these cases, \fIgit svn\fR will still create a Git branch, but instead of using an existing Git commit as the parent of the branch, it will read the SVN history of the directory the branch was copied from and create appropriate Git commits\&. This is indicated by the message "Initializing parent: <branchname>"\&.
.sp
Additionally, it will create a special branch named \fI<branchname>@<SVN\-Revision>\fR, where <SVN\-Revision> is the SVN revision number the branch was copied from\&. This branch will point to the newly created parent commit of the branch\&. If in SVN the branch was deleted and later recreated from a different version, there will be multiple such branches with an \fI@\fR\&.
.sp
Note that this may mean that multiple Git commits are created for a single SVN revision\&.
.sp
An example: in an SVN repository with a standard trunk/tags/branches layout, a directory trunk/sub is created in r\&.100\&. In r\&.200, trunk/sub is branched by copying it to branches/\&. \fIgit svn clone \-s\fR will then create a branch \fIsub\fR\&. It will also create new Git commits for r\&.100 through r\&.199 and use these as the history of branch \fIsub\fR\&. Thus there will be two Git commits for each revision from r\&.100 to r\&.199 (one containing trunk/, one containing trunk/sub/)\&. Finally, it will create a branch \fIsub@200\fR pointing to the new parent commit of branch \fIsub\fR (i\&.e\&. the commit for r\&.200 and trunk/sub/)\&.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.sp
For the sake of simplicity and interoperating with Subversion, it is recommended that all \fIgit svn\fR users clone, fetch and dcommit directly from the SVN server, and avoid all \fIgit clone\fR/\fIpull\fR/\fImerge\fR/\fIpush\fR operations between Git repositories and branches\&. The recommended method of exchanging code between Git branches and users is \fIgit format\-patch\fR and \fIgit am\fR, or just \(aqdcommit\(cqing to the SVN repository\&.
.sp
Running \fIgit merge\fR or \fIgit pull\fR is NOT recommended on a branch you plan to \fIdcommit\fR from because Subversion users cannot see any merges you\(cqve made\&. Furthermore, if you merge or pull from a Git branch that is a mirror of an SVN branch, \fIdcommit\fR may commit to the wrong branch\&.
.sp
If you do merge, note the following rule: \fIgit svn dcommit\fR will attempt to commit on top of the SVN commit named in
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git log \-\-grep=^git\-svn\-id: \-\-first\-parent \-1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
You \fImust\fR therefore ensure that the most recent commit of the branch you want to dcommit to is the \fIfirst\fR parent of the merge\&. Chaos will ensue otherwise, especially if the first parent is an older commit on the same SVN branch\&.
.sp
\fIgit clone\fR does not clone branches under the refs/remotes/ hierarchy or any \fIgit svn\fR metadata, or config\&. So repositories created and managed with using \fIgit svn\fR should use \fIrsync\fR for cloning, if cloning is to be done at all\&.
.sp
Since \fIdcommit\fR uses rebase internally, any Git branches you \fIgit push\fR to before \fIdcommit\fR on will require forcing an overwrite of the existing ref on the remote repository\&. This is generally considered bad practice, see the \fBgit-push\fR(1) documentation for details\&.
.sp
Do not use the \-\-amend option of \fBgit-commit\fR(1) on a change you\(cqve already dcommitted\&. It is considered bad practice to \-\-amend commits you\(cqve already pushed to a remote repository for other users, and dcommit with SVN is analogous to that\&.
.sp
When cloning an SVN repository, if none of the options for describing the repository layout is used (\-\-trunk, \-\-tags, \-\-branches, \-\-stdlayout), \fIgit svn clone\fR will create a Git repository with completely linear history, where branches and tags appear as separate directories in the working copy\&. While this is the easiest way to get a copy of a complete repository, for projects with many branches it will lead to a working copy many times larger than just the trunk\&. Thus for projects using the standard directory structure (trunk/branches/tags), it is recommended to clone with option \fB\-\-stdlayout\fR\&. If the project uses a non\-standard structure, and/or if branches and tags are not required, it is easiest to only clone one directory (typically trunk), without giving any repository layout options\&. If the full history with branches and tags is required, the options \fB\-\-trunk\fR / \fB\-\-branches\fR / \fB\-\-tags\fR must be used\&.
.sp
When using multiple \-\-branches or \-\-tags, \fIgit svn\fR does not automatically handle name collisions (for example, if two branches from different paths have the same name, or if a branch and a tag have the same name)\&. In these cases, use \fIinit\fR to set up your Git repository then, before your first \fIfetch\fR, edit the $GIT_DIR/config file so that the branches and tags are associated with different name spaces\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf
branches = stable/*:refs/remotes/svn/stable/*
branches = debug/*:refs/remotes/svn/debug/*
.fi
.if n \{\

.SH "BUGS"
.sp
We ignore all SVN properties except svn:executable\&. Any unhandled properties are logged to $GIT_DIR/svn/<refname>/unhandled\&.log
.sp
Renamed and copied directories are not detected by Git and hence not tracked when committing to SVN\&. I do not plan on adding support for this as it\(cqs quite difficult and time\-consuming to get working for all the possible corner cases (Git doesn\(cqt do it, either)\&. Committing renamed and copied files is fully supported if they\(cqre similar enough for Git to detect them\&.
.sp
In SVN, it is possible (though discouraged) to commit changes to a tag (because a tag is just a directory copy, thus technically the same as a branch)\&. When cloning an SVN repository, \fIgit svn\fR cannot know if such a commit to a tag will happen in the future\&. Thus it acts conservatively and imports all SVN tags as branches, prefixing the tag name with \fItags/\fR\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"

        branches = branches/*/project\-a:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/*
        branches = branches/release_*:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/release_*

Keep in mind that the \fI*\fR (asterisk) wildcard of the local ref (right of the \fI:\fR) \fBmust\fR be the farthest right path component; however the remote wildcard may be anywhere as long as it\(cqs an independent path component (surrounded by \fI/\fR or EOL)\&. This type of configuration is not automatically created by \fIinit\fR and should be manually entered with a text\-editor or using \fIgit config\fR\&.
.sp
Also note that only one asterisk is allowed per word\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
branches = branches/re*se:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/*
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
will match branches \fIrelease\fR, \fIrese\fR, \fIre123se\fR, however
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
branches = branches/re*s*e:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/*
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
will produce an error\&.
.sp
It is also possible to fetch a subset of branches or tags by using a comma\-separated list of names within braces\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[svn\-remote "huge\-project"]
        url = http://server\&.org/svn
        fetch = trunk/src:refs/remotes/trunk
        branches = branches/{red,green}/src:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/*
        tags = tags/{1\&.0,2\&.0}/src:refs/remotes/project\-a/tags/*
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Multiple fetch, branches, and tags keys are supported:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[svn\-remote "messy\-repo"]
        url = http://server\&.org/svn
        fetch = trunk/project\-a:refs/remotes/project\-a/trunk
        fetch = branches/demos/june\-project\-a\-demo:refs/remotes/project\-a/demos/june\-demo
        branches = branches/server/*:refs/remotes/project\-a/branches/*
        branches = branches/demos/2011/*:refs/remotes/project\-a/2011\-demos/*
        tags = tags/server/*:refs/remotes/project\-a/tags/*
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Creating a branch in such a configuration requires disambiguating which location to use using the \-d or \-\-destination flag:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git svn branch \-d branches/server release\-2\-3\-0
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Note that git\-svn keeps track of the highest revision in which a branch or tag has appeared\&. If the subset of branches or tags is changed after fetching, then $GIT_DIR/svn/\&.metadata must be manually edited to remove (or reset) branches\-maxRev and/or tags\-maxRev as appropriate\&.
